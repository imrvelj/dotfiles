	// Place your snippets for typescriptreact here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"React FC": {
		"prefix": "rfc",
		"body": [
			"import React from 'react'",
			"import styled from 'styled-components'",
			"",
			"export const $1 = () => {",
			"\treturn <Wrapper>Component</Wrapper>",
			"}",
			"",
			"const Wrapper = styled.div``",
		],
		"description": "React functional component"
	},
