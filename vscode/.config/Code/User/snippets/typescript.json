	// Place your snippets for typescript here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Unstated container": {
		"prefix": "ucont",
		"body": [
			"import { createContainer } from 'unstated-next'",
			"import { useState } from 'react'",
			"",
			"const defaultState = {}",
			"",
			"export function use$1(initialState = defaultState) {",
			"  const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)",
			"  return { state, setState }",
			"}",
			"",
			"export const $1Container = createContainer(use$1)",

		]
